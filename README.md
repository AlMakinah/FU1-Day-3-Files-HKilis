# FU1-1-3-files
Exercise on reading a file in loop

## Exercise 1

You need to create a new folder inside your exercise repository and name it `files`, then with Ruby you have to:

1. Create a file and name it `hello.txt`
2. Print `Hello` 15 times in 15 different lines
3. Close and save the file

Now double check the content of that file, if it has the right content, then here you go.

## Exercise 2

You need to read the file you created in the previous exercise (`hello.txt`), then the file should look like:

```
Hello World!
Hello World!
...
```

15 times.
